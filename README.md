## Setup - unzip, install, configure, run
1. Unzip to your Documents folder (or another folder, but you'll need to edit more paths.)

2. Download [Open Stage Control](https://openstagecontrol.ammd.net/download/) v1.25.5+ It‚Äôs a free and modular OSC / Midi controller. Unzip and move to your Applications folder. Start it and load _OSC Server.config_. In the server's 'load' setting, set your username and path to _LAS.json_ and save the config, then close and restart the server. A new window with the json file loaded will open. **_It will look strange until you run the LAS.scpt and click on a track in Logic._** TIP: Use an old phone, iPad, tablet, ‚Äîanything with a web browser‚Äî with LAS. Connect to the server by scanning the QR code in Open Stage Control or going to http://your-server-ip-address:8080.

3. Configure the following items.
MacOS Gatekeeper will prevent launching unsigned apps. In the Apps folder, right-click and open both MidiPipe.app and sendoscUNI and allow to run. Read more about Gatekeeper [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatekeeper_(macOS)#Override).
    Add sample library pictures to the _LibPics_ folder. Name them using the same prefix or suffix you use for tracks or art set names. Select a libCode aption in _LAS.scpt._ **_When adding new pics or changing their names in Finder, please restart Open Stage Control._**
 
    Open _LAS.scpt_ with Script Editor and select an artColorSetting.
   
    0 - Basic: All buttons are one color. (Default)
   
    1 - Logic: Logic‚Äôs piano roll art colors*. ü´£ _Set View > Set Note Color > By Articulation in piano roll._
   
    2 - Custom: Set custom art colors in the getArtColors handler function. (Adobe has a great [color resource](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel).)

4. Open Logic and create a project with art sets. Once a track is clicked, LAS will send data to Open Stage Control. **_Logic's main window must be open, but can be minimized._** I recommend ticking _Select tracks on region/marquee selection_ in _Logic Settings > Editing_ to ensure proper art set selection.

____________________

You made it! Congratulations! üôåüèº I‚Äôve included a couple of handy scripts as a reward. One starts everything, the other stops everything. Verify paths in _Start LAS_ and save, then open Terminal and type chmod +x and drag _Start LAS_ into the Terminal window and press Return. Do the same for _Stop LAS_. This will make them executable. When you double-click _Start LAS_, it will open MidiPipe, Open Stage Control and Script Editor and run the script. Accept any permission requests that may pop up. Terminal will tell you when it‚Äôs done. Press ‚åòQ to close Terminal.
 
_If you don‚Äôt want to see the LAS.json window because you‚Äôre using a device with a web browser to switch arts, stop the OSC server, check the box to the right of no-gui, save OSC Server.config and then restart the server._
 
The rest of the magic is up to you! üòâ
 
When you‚Äôre done having fun, use _Stop LAS_ to close everything. Except Logic. (I don‚Äôt want to accidentally lose _my-awesome-8bar-loop-update7b-final-mix-final-final.logicx_ project... again.)


## Known Issues
UI scripting is fragile and Logic has quirks. UI elements are tested in macOS Ventura+ and Logic 10.8+. If you‚Äôre brave, you can edit script elements with [UI Browser](https://latenightsw.com/freeware/ui-browser/).

*Color set not supported with Babylon Waves [Art Conductor](https://www.babylonwaves.com/logic/) sets, since they don't use corresponding values in articulation set .plist files.

The üÖ±Ô∏è symbol in the Babylon Waves articulation set path name may need to be removed by renaming to just "Art Conductor Logic". The shell might not interpret that symbol correctly.
 
Sadly, Apple Watch doesn‚Äôt have a browser‚Ä¶ yet. When it does, the image above will no longer be considered false advertising.


## To Do
If you have a suggestion, or find a bug, please report it on [GitHub](https://github.com/eakwarren/LAS/issues). I don‚Äôt promise a fix or tech support, but I‚Äôm happy to take a look. üôÇ
